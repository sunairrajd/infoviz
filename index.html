<h2 class=" text-white my-2">How to make an Impactful Information Visualisation?</h2>



<p class="para">Inorder to create an ideal Information Visualisation, our goal should always be generating design that people can understand and consumer easily.  The  can be segmented into the following.</p>

  </div>


  <div class ="col-lg-7 py-5">
  <h4 class=" text-white my-2">Life of an Information Visualisation project</h4>
  <p class="para text-white ">We can further look at these elements and understand how each part of these life process influence an Information Design project</p>
    <img class="my-2" src="img/3a.png " width="100%;"/>
  </div>

  <div class ="col-lg-7 py-5">
  <h4 class=" text-white my-2">Context</h4>

  <p class="para text-white my-3">Understanding the context will get you closer to your audience. Its about understanding humans and how we can relate to them through a medium. Context may include, age, literacy level, geographical location, accessibility, etc  </p>
  <h4 class = "quote">“If you create something that nobody uses, you’ve failed to communicate.”</h4>
</div>

<div class ="col-lg-7 py-5">
<h4 class=" text-white my-2">Making the most of a medium</h4>

<p class="para text-white my-3">Be it print / web/ immersive Tech. Every medium is different with its own pros and cons. It is required to understand the medium through with the visualisation is being published and make the most of the the what the medium can offer.
</p>
<p class="para text-white my-3">
Also it is unimaginable to think what the next wave of technology would be, In currentl world, John Maeda thinks that the technology is evolving on the basis of. Moore law. Its harder to predict what the next wave of technology would define Information Visualisation.
</p>
<img class="my-2" src="img/3b.png " width="100%;"/>
<p class="para text-white my-3">
Access to internet, increased broadband speeds have already powered the foundation of a technology wave. It is evident that we embrace the current technology and perhaps also try to look in the future even if the technology in their nascent stage
</p>

</div>

<div class ="col-lg-7 py-5">
<h4 class=" text-white my-2">Research</h4>

<p class="para text-white my-3">Research is a multidimensional element involves understanding users, topic, data. The intersection of the above elements will pave way for further exploration of the topic and the narrative itself. Good research will often result in good insights</p>
<img class="my-2" src="img/3c.png " width="60%;" style="margin:0 auto; display: block; opacity:0.6;"/>
<p class="para text-white my-3"> Research should also not happen in isolation. It should be happen in parallel with the existing world and events happening around you. This will help to find connection and discover correlation and influences.</p>
<img class ="my-2" src="img/3h.png" width="60%;" style="margin:0 auto; display: block;"/>
</div>


<div class ="col-lg-7 py-5">
<h4 class=" text-white my-2">Narrative</h4>

<p class="para text-white my-3">Narrative involves looking at the insights and bringing out the story. The aim of the story should be simple and shouldn’t involve a lot of trajectories. Always keep in mind that designer is not the end user for this project.</p>
<img class="my-2" src="img/3d.png " width="60%;" style="margin:0 auto; display: block;"/>
<div class = "quote">“You can risk oversimplifying and talking down to the audience. Or you can do the opposite and try to cram too much overwhelming detail down their throats.”</div>
</div>


<div class ="col-lg-7 py-5">
<h4 class=" text-white my-2">Visualise and Prototype</h4>

<p class="para text-white my-3">The Insights generated through the research and narrative section have to be visualised. Readily available visualisation tools were not designed to understand human emotions and feels. It should be the responsibility of the designer to utilise these known human characteristics to compose the visualisations.</p>

<div class = "quote">“Visualization can be a very important step in understanding a set of data, but the visualization itself often does not explain the data. So we need to be careful to not let the tools make decisions, but to use tools to help explain the data."</div>
<p class = "para text-white my-3">Protyping makes it easier to find the best possible way to communicate the narrative efficiently with bare bare minimum intervention of ornamentation.  The focus should be to be explain the data and not essentially make its aesthetically pleasing. As it goes without saying ‘Good Design is aesthetically good'</p>
<img class="my-4" src="img/3e.png " width="60%;" style="margin:0 auto; display:block;"/>
<div class = "quote">Good design should disappear, and let data reveal itself. Design shouldn’t be a mask in front of the data, or a code that needs to be learned before it can be used.</div>
</div>

<div class ="col-lg-7 py-5">
<h4 class=" text-white my-2">Interact and Consume</h4>
<p class="para text-white my-3">Interaction doesn’t necessarily have to be something to touch or play with. It could be both tangible and intangible. Interaction with the user can be made possible using motion, color, scale, composition. It plays a crucial role in how deeply the narrative gets to the user and how impactful it would be in altering user’s choices, opinions in the future. Interaction also has to happen expecting minimal contribution from the user </p>
<div class = "quote">“Once you got your reader to feel something, you often don’t want to stop there. You want them to do something: donate, participate, etc.”</div>
<p class="para text-white my-3">With the advent of technology, personalisation has become a key feature to create impact. It tells a unique story that nobody has ever told to anyone. It connects the user more deeply and hence better results</p>
  <img class="my-2" src="img/3f.png " width="50%;" style="margin:0 auto; display:block;"/>

<p class = "para text-white my-2">Consuming an information visualisation should require minimum effort from the user. The information visualisation has to draw attention from the user but still has to stay true to its sense of fulfilling its purpose. </p>
